This controller will keep the car a safe distance between the ego and the lead car

Test at speeds of no more than 60 mph. The controller is supposed to match the lead car's velocity. The ego velocity will fluctuate but hopefully not by too much that it becomes bothersome to the driver. Higher speeds will give higher space gaps.

We don't have any way to account for rapid changes to the input into the controller, like erratic driving from the lead car.
