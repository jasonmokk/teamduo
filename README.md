Max and Jason's CS 3891 Project

This controller aims to maintain smooth and safe driving by calculating the appropriate space gap based on a time-gap threshold and adjusting the ego car's acceleration proportionally to minimize distance error and relative velocity. We expect it to maintain relative velocity around 0 m/s, stabilize the lead distance near the desired threshold, and ensure acceleration commands are capped at ±3 m/s² for smooth and realistic operation.
