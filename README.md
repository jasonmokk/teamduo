Max and Jason's CS 3891 Project

This controller calculates the appropriate space gap by multiplying our desired time gap of 3 seconds by the ego velocity, and using it to calculate the desired acceleration to correct the discrepancy between the desired and actual space gaps. The acceleration is also capped at 3m/s^2 to rapid changes in speed.
